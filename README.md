# Catholic Diocese App

## About

The Catholic Diocese App was created in 2011 by Jeff Geerling of Midwestern Mac, LLC, originally for the Archdiocese of St. Louis, MO, USA. The app was intended to help not only the St. Louis Archdiocese, but also any other diocese that wanted to build an App for iOS devices.

## Current Status

The app uses code from a variety of Open Source projects and libraries for iOS, and is currently being reworked from a 'get it working' state that was made to get a release of the Catholic STL app out.

Please help us make this app more universal, more stable, and able to be built easily for different needs in different dioceses.

## Development

You can follow development and progress on this app on GitHub and on Open Source Catholic:

  - GitHub: https://github.com/geerlingguy/Catholic-Diocese-App
  - Open Source Catholic: http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/project/catholic-diocese-app

Please help us make this app even better!
